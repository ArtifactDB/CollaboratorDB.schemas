# CollaboratorDB schemas in an R package

This bundles the [CollaboratorDB schemas](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/CollaboratorDB-schemas) into an R package,
so that it can be easily referenced by other packages without requiring internet connectivity. 
If you're looking to do something useful with these schemas, check out the [**CollaboratorDB** R package](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/CollaboratorDB-R) instead.
